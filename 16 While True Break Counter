while True:
  color = input("Enter a color: ")
  if color == "red":
    break
  else:
    print("Cool color!")
print("I don't like red")

in this case, if I enter "red" for the first input, it will stop looping. 
But if I enter anything else, it will keep looping the same question "Enter a color:" Until I type out red.

Direction: 
Create a "Name the Lyrics" game. 
Write your favorite song lyrics with a word or two missing. 
The user has to figure out the correct song lyric in as few attempts as possible. 
Find the true lyric master among you!

Example:
Fill in the blank lyrics!

(Type in the blank lyrics and see if you are as cool as me.)
Never going to ______ you up.
put
Nope, try again.
Never going to ______ you up.
let
Nope, try again.
Never going to ______ you up.
give
Well done! It only took you 3 attempts.


print("Welcome to Name the Song Lyric")
print()
print("Figure out the missing word as quickly as you can!")
print()

counter = 1
while True:
  lyrics = input("I don't wanna ______ a thing. ")
  if lyrics == "miss" or lyrics == "Miss":
    print("You got it!")
  else:
    print("Nope! Try again!")
    counter +=1
  if lyrics == "miss":
    break
print("Thanks for playing!")

print("You got the correct lyrics in", counter, "attempt(s).")
