what I did:
day = 60 * 60 * 24 
print(day,"seconds")

leapyear = 366 * day 
print(leapyear, "seconds")

year = 365 * day 
print(year, "seconds")

after correction: 
day_this_year = int(input("How many days are in this year"))

days_in_year = 365 
days_in_learpyear = 366
hours_in_day = 24
minutes_in_hour = 60
seconds_in_minutes = 60 

results = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minutes 

leapyear_results = days_in_learpyear * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minutes

if day_this_year == 366:
  print ( "Number of seconds in a lear year are", leapyear_results)

else:
  print ("Number of seconds in a year are", results)
