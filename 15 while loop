exit = "no"

while exit == "no": 
  animal_sound = input("What animal sound do you want to hear?")

  if animal_sound == "cow" or animal_sound == "Cow" : 
    print ("Moo")
  elif animal_sound == "cat" or animal_sound == "Cat": 
    print ("Meow")
  else:
   print("I don't know that animal sound")

  exit = input("Do you want to exit?: ")

* while makes it an infinte loop, so if I type "No" to "Do you want to exit" it will constantly loop.
